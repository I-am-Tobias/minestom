Minestom is an open-source library that enables developers to create their own Minecraft server software, without any code from Mojang.

The main difference between Mojang's vanilla server and a minestom-based server, is that ours does not contain any features by default!
However, we have a complete API which is designed to allow you to make anything possible, with ease.
